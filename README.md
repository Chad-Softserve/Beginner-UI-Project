![Mobile Design](design\mobile-design.jpg)

Your challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The css clamp() method.
HTML Font loading.
CSS @font-face usage.
Using git on terminal.

### Continued development

Further practice using git in the terminal.
Refine @font-face usages in further projects.
Css clamp() will definitely be used going forward.

### Useful resources

- [Git Cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) - This helped me learn and understand the commands used in the terminal.
- [CSS w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) -  Helpful in learning about css and recapping on information already known.
